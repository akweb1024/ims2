  #### **Example**
    # HIRING SEQUENCE FRAMEWORK:
    
    ## Pre-Product (0-3 people)
    """
    GOAL: Ship product, find PMF
    
    HIRE ONLY:
    - Co-founder(s) if missing critical skill
    - One engineer if needed for speed
    
    DON'T HIRE:
    - Business roles (no business yet)
    - Managers (nothing to manage)
    - Specialists (need generalists)
    
    PRINCIPLE: Every hire should write code or talk to customers.
    """
    
    ## Early Traction (3-10 people)
    """
    GOAL: Prove retention, find repeatable growth
    
    TYPICAL SEQUENCE:
    1. Engineers (2-4) - Ship product
    2. First GTM hire - Depends on motion:
       - PLG: Growth/marketing generalist
       - Sales: First AE (after founder sales)
    3. Designer - If product requires it
    4. First ops/support hire - When founders can't do it
    
    DON'T HIRE YET:
    - VP-level anything (too early)
    - Specialists (need breadth)
    - HR (use contractor/fractional)
    
    PRINCIPLE: Hire doers, not managers. Everyone ICs.
    """
    
    ## Growth (10-30 people)
    """
    GOAL: Scale what's working
    
    TYPICAL ADDITIONS:
    - More engineers (team size ~50% eng)
    - Sales team (if sales-led)
    - Marketing (content, demand gen)
    - Customer success
    - First people ops hire
    
    FIRST MANAGERS:
    - Promote from within if possible
    - First external manager: Eng or Sales lead
    - Keep spans wide (7-10 reports)
    
    PRINCIPLE: Add fuel to fire, don't create new fires.
    """
    
    ## Scaling (30-100 people)
    """
    GOAL: Build organization that scales
    
    ADDITIONS:
    - Function heads (VP Eng, VP Sales, etc.)
    - Specialists (security, data, legal)
    - Middle management
    - Recruiting function
    - Finance
    
    TRANSITIONS:
    - From generalists to specialists
    - From flat to hierarchical
    - From intuition to process
    
    PRINCIPLE: Systems replace heroics.

  #### **Name**
Role Definition Framework
  #### **Description**
How to define what you're actually hiring for
  #### **When**
Opening any new role
  #### **Example**
    # ROLE DEFINITION:
    
    ## The Problem, Not The Title
    """
    WRONG WAY:
    "We need a Head of Marketing"
    
    RIGHT WAY:
    "We need someone to:
    - Generate 100 qualified leads/month
    - Build content engine for SEO
    - Run paid experiments efficiently
    - Work closely with sales on handoff"
    
    Title comes from the problem, not the other way around.
    """
    
    ## Role Scoping Questions
    """
    1. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
       - What's not getting done today?
       - What would a great outcome look like?
       - How will you measure success?
    
    2. WHY NOW?
       - What changed that makes this urgent?
       - What happens if you don't hire?
       - Is this problem permanent or temporary?
    
    3. WHO COULD DO THIS?
       - What skills are required?
       - What experience is helpful?
       - Could someone internal grow into it?
    
    4. WHAT'S THE LEVEL?
       - Need manager or IC?
       - How much autonomy required?
       - Who will they report to?
    """
    
    ## Role Types at Startups
    """
    BUILDER (what you usually need):
    - Can do the work themselves
    - Low ego, high output
    - Comfortable with ambiguity
    - Examples: Engineers, first marketers, first salespeople
    
    LEADER (what you think you need):
    - Manages and scales teams
    - Sets strategy and direction
    - Hires and develops people
    - Only needed after you have team to lead
    
    COMMON MISTAKE:
    Hiring leader when you need builder.
    "Head of Marketing" with 0 team = expensive marketer.
    """
    
    ## The Anti-Resume
    """
    Define what you DON'T want:
    - "Has only worked at large companies"
    - "Needs direct reports to be happy"
    - "Uncomfortable writing/building directly"
    - "Requires process and structure to succeed"
    
    This is often more useful than the resume.

    # STARTUP COMPENSATION:
    
    ## The Equation
    """
    TOTAL COMP = Base + Equity + Benefits + Intangibles
    
    STARTUP REALITY:
    - Base: Below market (often 60-80%)
    - Equity: Above market (the bet)
    - Benefits: Basic
    - Intangibles: Mission, learning, impact
    
    People join startups for equity upside and impact.
    If they want market base, they want wrong thing.
    """
    
    ## Salary Benchmarks (US, 2024)
    """
    ENGINEERING:
    - Junior (0-2y): $90-130K
    - Mid (2-5y): $130-180K
    - Senior (5+y): $160-220K
    - Staff+: $200-280K
    
    STARTUP DISCOUNT:
    - Pre-seed: 30-40% below
    - Seed: 20-30% below
    - Series A: 10-20% below
    - Series B+: Near market
    
    Note: These are base salaries. Add equity value.
    """
    
    ## Equity Guide
    """
    EMPLOYEE EQUITY RANGES (% of company):
    
    First 5 employees:
    - Critical role: 1-2%
    - Important role: 0.5-1%
    - Standard role: 0.25-0.5%
    
    Employees 5-15:
    - Senior/critical: 0.25-0.5%
    - Standard: 0.1-0.25%
    
    Employees 15-50:
    - Senior: 0.1-0.25%
    - Standard: 0.05-0.1%
    
    FACTORS THAT INCREASE:
    - Earlier stage (more risk)
    - Critical skill gap
    - Exceptional candidate
    - Below-market salary
    
    FACTORS THAT DECREASE:
    - Later stage
    - More competition for role
    - Higher salary
    """
    
    ## Equity Structures
    """
    STANDARD TERMS:
    - 4-year vesting
    - 1-year cliff
    - Monthly vesting after cliff
    - 10-year exercise window (preferred)
    
    OPTIONS VS RSUs:
    - Early stage: ISOs (tax advantaged)
    - Late stage: RSUs (simpler)
    - Most startups: ISOs until late
    
    REFRESH GRANTS:
    - Every 2 years for retaining key people
    - Usually 25-50% of initial grant
    - Vest over 4 years, no cliff
    """
    
    ## Negotiation Philosophy
    """
    WHAT TO FLEX:
    - Equity amount
    - Vesting schedule (acceleration)
    - Title
    - Role scope
    
    WHAT NOT TO FLEX (MUCH):
    - Base salary bands
    - Equity terms for everyone
    - Cliff existence
    
    RULE: Be generous on equity, tight on cash.
    Cash burns runway. Equity aligns incentives.

    # INTERVIEW PROCESS:
    
    ## Startup Interview Philosophy
    """
    YOU'RE NOT GOOGLE:
    - Can't afford 6 round process
    - Candidates have other options
    - Speed is competitive advantage
    - You're selling as much as evaluating
    
    GOAL:
    - High signal in minimal time
    - Good candidate experience
    - Quick decisions
    - Close rate matters
    """

    """
    STAGE 1: Screen (30 min)
    - Phone/video with hiring manager
    - Motivation and fit check
    - High-level skill validation
    - Explain role and company
    - Decision: Within 24 hours
    
    STAGE 2: Work Sample (2-4 hours)

    - Evaluate actual skill
    - Decision: Within 48 hours
    
    STAGE 3: Onsite/Final (2-3 hours)
    - Deep dive with team
    - Culture fit assessment
    - Founder conversation
    - Q&A for candidate
    - Decision: Same day if possible
    
    TOTAL: 1-2 weeks, not 1-2 months
    """
    
    ## What To Assess
    """
    SKILLS (can they do job?):
    - Work sample is best predictor
    - Past work examples
    - Technical depth in area
    - Specific not generic questions
    
    MOTIVATION (do they want this job?):
    - Why startups?
    - Why this company?
    - Why this role?
    - Red flag: Doesn't ask questions
    
    CULTURE FIT (will they thrive?):
    - Comfortable with ambiguity?
    - Self-directed?
    - Collaborative?
    - Values alignment
    
    TRAJECTORY (are they growing?):
    - Learning from past roles?
    - Self-aware about weaknesses?
    - Taking on new challenges?
    """
    
    ## Interview Red Flags
    """
    PROCESS:
    ✗ Talks about what "we" did (no individual contribution)
    ✗ Blames others for failures
    ✗ Can't explain decisions simply
    ✗ Asks only about perks/benefits
    ✗ No questions about the work
    
    MOTIVATION:
    ✗ Primarily seeking stability
    ✗ "Ready to slow down"
    ✗ Wants to manage before building
    ✗ Title-focused conversation
    
    CULTURE:
    ✗ "That's not my job" mentality
    ✗ Needs a lot of structure
    ✗ Uncomfortable with feedback
    ✗ Dismissive of "simple" work

    # CLOSING CANDIDATES:
    
    ## The Startup Sell
    """
    YOU CAN'T COMPETE ON:
    - Base salary
    - Brand recognition
    - Job security
    - Perks and benefits
    
    YOU CAN COMPETE ON:
    - Impact and ownership
    - Learning and growth
    - Equity upside
    - Mission and vision
    - Team quality
    - Speed and shipping
    """
    
    ## The Close Process
    """
    BEFORE OFFER:
    - Understand their priorities
    - Know their alternatives
    - Address concerns proactively
    - Get them excited about the work
    
    THE OFFER:
    - Call, don't email
    - Be enthusiastic (you want them)
    - Walk through all components
    - Explain equity clearly
    - Give them time but create urgency
    
    AFTER OFFER:
    - Follow up call to answer questions
    - Connect them with team members
    - Send materials (deck, press, etc.)
    - Founder check-in before deadline
    """
    
    ## Competitive Situations
    """
    VS BIG COMPANY:
    "You'll learn more in 1 year here than 5 years there.
    You'll ship to production this month, not next year.
    You'll work directly with founders, not middle managers."
    
    VS ANOTHER STARTUP:
    Focus on: Team, traction, market, your specific opportunity.
    Don't trash talk. Respect their options.
    
    VS COUNTEROFFER:
    They already wanted to leave. New money doesn't fix the why.
    If they're serious about startup life, they won't be swayed.
    """
    
    ## Equity Conversations
    """
    COMMON CANDIDATE MISTAKES:
    - Focusing on % not value
    - Ignoring dilution
    - Not understanding vesting
    - Overvaluing near-term salary
    
    HOW TO EXPLAIN:
    1. Show the math on outcomes
    2. Compare to big company equity
    3. Explain the upside scenarios
    4. Be honest about the risks
    
    EXAMPLE FRAMING:
    "0.5% of a $100M company is $500K.
    We're going for $1B, which would be $5M.
    Of course there's risk, but that's the bet."
    """
    
    ## When To Walk Away
    """
    PASS ON CANDIDATES WHO:
    - Are primarily motivated by salary
    - Need too much convincing
    - Seem lukewarm after meeting team
    - Red flags that you're rationalizing
    - Negotiating endlessly
    
    RULE: If you're not excited, don't hire.
    A mediocre yes is worse than a strong no.
    """
    

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Hiring Your Weakness
  #### **Description**
Hiring senior to avoid learning
  #### **Why**
    Founders often hire senior people in areas they're uncomfortable with
    instead of learning the basics themselves. Then they can't evaluate
    performance, can't give direction, and often make bad hires. You need
    baseline competence before you can hire for it.
    
  #### **Instead**
Learn basics yourself first. Hire someone better than you, but not a black box.

---
  #### **Name**
Title Inflation
  #### **Description**
Giving big titles to attract candidates
  #### **Why**
    "VP of Marketing" for employee #5 creates problems. When you hire a real
    VP, what's #5? You've capped their growth or set up conflict. Titles at
    startups should reflect reality, with room to grow.
    
  #### **Instead**
Start with IC titles. "Head of" when they have team. VP when there's real org.

---
  #### **Name**
Hiring Ahead
  #### **Description**
Hiring for the company you want to be
  #### **Why**
    Hiring a COO at 10 people because "we'll need one eventually" wastes
    money and creates friction. The COO of a 10-person company is different
    from a 100-person company. Hire for what you need now, not what you'll
    need in 2 years.
    
  #### **Instead**
Hire for next 18 months. Revisit when you get there.

---
  #### **Name**
Resume Worship
  #### **Description**
Over-indexing on prestigious backgrounds
  #### **Why**
    FAANG experience doesn't mean startup success. Big company skills often
    don't transfer. The engineer who built at Google had 10,000 people
    supporting them. At your startup, they have 3. Prestigious background
    is signal, not proof.
    
  #### **Instead**
Evaluate for startup context. Work sample over resume.

---
  #### **Name**
Desperation Hiring
  #### **Description**
Filling seats because you're overwhelmed
  #### **Why**
    When founders are drowning, any help looks good. But bad hires make
    things worse. Now you're drowning AND managing a bad hire. The desperation
    mindset leads to lowered bars and rationalized red flags.
    
  #### **Instead**
Slow down. Bad hire costs more than gap. Maintain your bar.

---
  #### **Name**
Clone Hiring
  #### **Description**
Only hiring people like you
  #### **Why**
    Founders often hire people who think and act like them. This feels
    comfortable but creates blind spots. You need different perspectives,
    not an echo chamber. Diverse thinking leads to better decisions.
    
  #### **Instead**
Hire for complementary skills and perspectives. Discomfort is feature.

---
  #### **Name**
Consensus Hiring
  #### **Description**
Requiring everyone to love the candidate
  #### **Why**
    "Everyone needs to agree" sounds fair but selects for bland. Strong
    candidates often polarize. One person's "too aggressive" is another's
    "high-agency." Consensus leads to safe, mediocre hires.
    
  #### **Instead**
Hire for strong yes from hiring manager. Vetos require articulated reason.
